# Introduction

Besides creative aspects, programming also involves performing boring, repeating tasks. Some of them can be solved by creating reusable libraries. For the rest, we can leverage code generation. This is what this book is about. It shows how to make use of Schematics, the code generator behind the Angular CLI to generate custom Angular code. Using an example, you will learn how to scaffold a new Schematics project, how to work with templates, and how to manipulate existing code.

## Used Version 

The samples shown are using Angular 6.x and the Angular CLI 6.x. If you have trouble with executing the samples, make sure that you have installed those versions.

## Angular Labs Project means Changes ahead!

When writing this, Schematics was a Angular Labs Project which means that it is experimental and can change in future.

Nevertheless, I think it can still be useful to automate repeating tasks even though it means you have to update it from time to time.

## BETA-Book
